# 1-Minute Pitch Structure - AI Travel Planner

## 🎯 **Slide Structure (3 slides + demo)**

### **Slide 1: The Challenge (10 seconds)**
**Title**: "Travel Planning is Complex"
**Content**:
- Planning a trip takes hours of research across multiple sites
- Flights, hotels, activities, schedules - overwhelming choices
- **Solution**: What if AI could do it all in seconds?

### **Slide 2: AI-Powered Development Approach (20 seconds)**  
**Title**: "Built with AI Assistance in 4 Hours"
**Content**:
```
Development Stack:
├─ 🤖 Claude Code (Sonnet 4) - AI-powered development
├─ 🔗 AWS MCP Server - Direct AWS documentation access  
├─ ☁️  AWS Demo Account - Bedrock AgentCore deployment
└─ 🚀 Result: Multi-agent travel planner LIVE on AWS
```
**Key Point**: "Showcasing AI-accelerated development - from concept to production in a hackathon"

### **Slide 3: Architecture & Results (15 seconds)**
**Title**: "Multi-Agent System on AWS Bedrock AgentCore"
**Visual**:
```
User: "Plan Munich trip for Oktoberfest" → [AI Orchestrator] → Sub-Agents:
                                                              ├─ ✈️ Flights/Hotels  
                                                              ├─ 🏰 Activities
                                                              └─ 📅 Itinerary
                                                              ↓
                                          Complete trip plan in <1 second
```
**Stats**: 
- ⚡ <1 second response
- 🏗️ 4 coordinated agents  
- ☁️ Production AWS deployment

### **Live Demo (15 seconds)**
**Command**: `agentcore invoke '{"prompt": "Plan 3-day Munich Oktoberfest trip, $1000 budget"}'`
**Show**: Complete JSON response with flights, hotels, activities, daily schedule

## 🎤 **1-Minute Speech Script**

**[10s] Problem Setup:**
> "Travel planning is painful - hours spent juggling flights, hotels, activities. What if AI could plan your entire trip in seconds?"

**[20s] Development Story:**
> "Here's what's unique: this entire system was built WITH AI assistance. Using Claude Code with AWS's MCP server, we went from concept to production deployment in just 2.5 hours. This demonstrates AI-accelerated development in action."

**[15s] Technical Achievement:**
> "The result: a sophisticated multi-agent system on AWS Bedrock AgentCore. One orchestrator coordinates three specialized agents - flights, activities, and itinerary planning. All deployed serverless with sub-second responses."

**[15s] Live Demo:**
> "Let me show you - [run demo command] - complete trip plan generated in real-time with flights, hotels, activities, and daily schedule."
