## Idea 3: The Personalized AI Travel Planner ✈️
The Idea: A conversational AI agent that plans a complete, personalized travel itinerary. It goes beyond simple search by understanding user preferences and combining information from multiple sources.

How it Works:

Trip Agent (The Orchestrator): The main conversational agent. A user would say, "Plan me a 3-day weekend trip to Munich for Oktoberfest. I'm on a budget, love historical sites, and enjoy craft beer."

Flights & Hotel Agent: This agent connects to real APIs (like Skyscanner or Booking.com) to find flight and accommodation options that fit the budget and dates.

Activities Agent: Based on the user's interests ("history" and "craft beer"), this agent finds relevant museums, walking tours, and top-rated beer gardens, and even checks their opening hours.

Itinerary Agent: Assembles all the information into a logical day-by-day schedule, which it presents back to the user.

Why it's a Great Hackathon Project:

Use of AWS Services: A perfect fit for AgentCore Gateway and Identity to manage different user trips. AgentCore Memory is absolutely critical to remember the user's preferences throughout the conversation.

Agent Sophistication: Demonstrates powerful real-world tool use by connecting to multiple external APIs.

Pitch Clarity: It's a very visual and relatable project. The demo is exciting because you are showing live, relevant data being pulled and organized in real-time.
