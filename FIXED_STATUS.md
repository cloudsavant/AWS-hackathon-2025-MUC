# 🎉 **FIXED: AI Travel Planner Web Interface**

## ✅ **Issue Resolved!**

The JSON parsing issue with agentcore responses has been **completely fixed**! 

### **What was the problem?**
- agentcore outputs a decorated response with headers and borders
- The actual JSON comes after "Response:" marker
- Original parser expected pure JSON format

### **What was fixed?**
- ✅ **Enhanced JSON Parser**: Now extracts JSON from agentcore's decorated output
- ✅ **Response Format Support**: Handles both `raw_data` and direct response formats
- ✅ **Better Error Handling**: More robust parsing with multiple fallback methods
- ✅ **Detailed Logging**: Server now logs parsing steps for debugging
